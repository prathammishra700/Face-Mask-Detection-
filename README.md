#  Face Mask Detection System
**Python | Deep Learning | TensorFlow | OpenCV**

A smart AI-based system to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not — built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and deployed via **Google Colab**.

---

##  Overview
This project implements a **Deep Learning-based Face Mask Detection System** capable of classifying images of people **with** and **without masks**.  
It leverages **CNN architecture (TensorFlow/Keras)** to learn facial features and differentiate between masked and unmasked faces with high accuracy.  

This project contributes to **public health monitoring**, **safety compliance**, and **automation in surveillance systems**.

---

##  Key Features
 **Binary Classification** – Detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not  
 **High Accuracy** – Achieved over 97% validation accuracy using CNN  
 **Image-based Detection** – Works with camera feeds or preloaded datasets  
 **Beautiful Visualizations** – Accuracy & loss plots, confusion matrix, and sample predictions  
 **Performance Metrics** – Precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
 **Model Export** – Trained model saved as `mask_detector_model.h5`  
 **Google Colab Ready** – Easily executable notebook with full explanation
